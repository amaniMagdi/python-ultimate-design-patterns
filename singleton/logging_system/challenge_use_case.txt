Implement a Flexible Logging Mechanism

Develop a logging mechanism that supports multiple log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
The mechanism should allow dynamically setting the log level.

Requirements:

    When a log level is set, only messages of that level and more critical levels (e.g., INFO and higher) 
    should be logged.
    For example:
        If the log level is set to INFO, messages for INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL should be logged,
        but DEBUG messages should not.
