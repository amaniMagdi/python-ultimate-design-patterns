Let's consider a scenario where we have a weather application that expects to receive city and country 
to show users weather information in XML format.
It's required to change the current structure of Weather Application, 
to receive a location of longitude and latitude then extract the city and country from it 
and use the current third-party which takes city and country. 
Also we need to show the information in JSON format.
