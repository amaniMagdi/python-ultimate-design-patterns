# python-ultimate-design-patterns
In this repo we will design and build maintainable, extensible and robust python packages, each package is a type of design pattern with its UML diagram.
#### 1- Behavioral Design Patterns:

 - **Observer**

> Is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription
> mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to
> the object theyâ€™re observing. The repo contains below codes.
> 	 - online market place example.
> 	 - newsletter example.

- **Strategy**

> Is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
> put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
> Below code examples are included:
> 	 - e-commerce
> 	 - notification service
>  	- message_formatter

- **Template Method**

> Is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
> Below code examples are included:
> 	 - cv_report_generation
> 	 - message_formatter
>  	- video_preset

- **Memento**

> Is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.
> It separates dependency between **History**, **Object State** and **Context**.
> Below code examples are included:
> 	 - text_editor
> 	 - canvas
